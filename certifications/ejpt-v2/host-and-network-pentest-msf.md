# Host & Network pentest (MSF)

### Scanning computer of a network's PC with our current access&#x20;

* scan ports

```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp

### ip route&#x20;

* kinda pivoting
* to scan victim 2 inside different network (we need access to any pc of that network)

```bash
run autoroute -s $IP 
# here ip of vitcim-1 would be different (not the IP we pwned the machine with)

background 
#bg the current session

# use the tcp port scan module
set RHOSTS victim-2 #victim 2 address
```

```bash
load wmap

#specify sites here
wmap_sites -a $IP

#set target url
wmap_targets -t http://$IP/

#list sites
wmap_sites -l
